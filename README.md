## Introduction

The **go-genai** SDK allows developers to access Google's generative AI models easily. This toolkit is designed to simplify the integration process, making it accessible for both novice and experienced developers. By using this SDK, you can quickly build applications that leverage cutting-edge AI technology.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly connect to Google's generative models with minimal setup.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation to guide you through the integration process.
- **Robust Performance**: Designed to handle various workloads efficiently.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of developers who are also working with this SDK.

## Installation

To get started with **go-genai**, you need to install the SDK. You can download the latest version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/radhika030/go-genai/releases). Once downloaded, execute the installation file as per the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Usage

Using the **go-genai** SDK is straightforward. After installation, you can import the package into your Go application. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to get started:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/radhika030/go-genai"
)

func main() {
    client := genai.NewClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
    response, err := client.GenerateText("Your prompt here")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Generated Text:", response)
}
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the client and generate text based on a given prompt. Make sure to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.

## Examples

Here are a few more examples to help you understand how to use the SDK effectively:

### Text Generation

```go
response, err := client.GenerateText("Tell me a story about a brave knight.")
```

### Image Generation

```go
imageResponse, err := client.GenerateImage("A sunset over a mountain range.")
```

### Data Analysis

```go
dataResponse, err := client.AnalyzeData("Analyze this dataset for trends.")
```

These examples show how versatile the SDK can be in different scenarios.
